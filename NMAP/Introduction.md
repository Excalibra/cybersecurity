# Introduction

Do you find yourself constantly searching for low-cost and no-cost tools to add to your cybersecurity toolbox? If you're like me, the answer is definitely yes. The problem is that some of these tools don’t deserve to be there because they either don’t do what they claim to do, or what they do is simply not that important. I’m here to show you that the Nmap software suite is one of those few tools that will exceed your expectations.

## Nmap - What It Is and Why It's Important - NM
NMAP means Network Mapper, it can create network inventory, monitor host and service uptime, identify open ports running services and their version determining OS, inspect firewalls and rule sets, and produce both searchable and report quality output.

According to the official Nmap website, Nmap stands for Network Mapper, but I don’t think that gives it enough credit. It’s a free and open-source utility for network discovery and security auditing. Nmap crafts and sends IP packets onto the wire to discover and interrogate devices on private networks and the Internet. Originally developed in 1997 by Gordon Lyon, known online and at conferences like Defcon as Fyodor, Nmap has become an indispensable tool in the cybersecurity community. In this course, I’ll refer to Nmap as a suite of products because it includes other tools that can be used independently. For example, Zenmap is its graphical user interface, Npcap is its packet capture library, and tools like Ncat, Nping, and Ndiff provide additional capabilities that work behind the scenes.

I personally consider Nmap the Cybersecurity Swiss Army knife because it’s one tool that can do a lot of things. It can create a network inventory, monitor host and service uptime, identify open ports and their running services, determine operating system versions, inspect firewalls and their rule sets, and produce searchable and report-quality output. If you haven’t already, I strongly suggest adding Nmap to your cybersecurity toolbox.

We’ve covered what Nmap is and how it can be used, but why is it so important? The fact is, every real hacker—no matter the color of their hat—uses it. Almost every certification test on cybersecurity, especially ethical hacking and penetration testing, requires some knowledge of Nmap. No matter what role you serve as part of an IT or cybersecurity team, knowing Nmap is essential. Nmap is flexible, meaning it can be used for a variety of purposes with numerous techniques. It’s powerful, not only because of the range of things it can do but also because it does them quickly and efficiently. It’s also portable, running on almost any operating system and leaving no trace when removed.

Despite its versatility, getting started with Nmap is easy. Whether you prefer a command line or a graphical user interface, Nmap can scan an entire network with just 16 characters. Perhaps the best thing about Nmap is that it’s completely free, but that doesn’t diminish its value. Nmap is widely acclaimed and popular, having won many awards, been featured in tech journals, research papers, magazines, books, movies, and even a comic book. If you want to see an example, search for "Trinity uses Nmap" on YouTube, and you’ll find a [clip of Trinity from The Matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PxTAn4g20U) performing an Nmap scan before launching an attack.
