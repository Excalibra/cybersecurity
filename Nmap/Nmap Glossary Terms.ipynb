Any detected malicious activity or violation is usually reported to an administrator or collected centrally via a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. A SIEM system aggregates outputs from multiple sources and uses alarm-filtering techniques to differentiate malicious activity from false positives."

Evasion\nIn network security, evasion refers to bypassing an information security device to deliver exploits, attacks, or other malware to a target network or system without being detected. Evasion techniques are commonly used to bypass network-based intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) but can also be employed to circumvent firewalls and evade malware analysis. Additionally, evasions may target network security devices to crash them, rendering them ineffective against subsequent attacks."
