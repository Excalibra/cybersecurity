## Categories of Tools in Cybersecurity Operations

### 1. Information Gathering Tools

- Used to collect data about potential targets or systems before initiating further actions.
- Examples:
  - DNS Reconnaissance: Tools for extracting DNS information, such as subdomains, IP mappings, and record types.
  - Purpose: Understand the infrastructure and locate vulnerabilities in systems.

### 2. Vulnerability Analysis Tools

- Identify weaknesses in systems that can be exploited.
- Examples:
  - OpenVAS: A tool for scanning systems to identify known vulnerabilities.
  - Purpose: Map out potential entry points for an attack and prepare mitigation strategies.

### 3. Wireless Attack Tools

- Focus on compromising wireless networks and extracting sensitive data.
- Examples:
  - Tools for cracking wireless access points or decrypting network keys.
  - Purpose: Assess the security of wireless setups and identify exploitable flaws.

### 4. Web Application Testing Tools

- Test web applications for vulnerabilities by manipulating inputs and analyzing responses.
- Examples:
  - Fuzzers: Tools used to inject random or malicious data into web application inputs to trigger unexpected behavior.
  - Purpose: Identify exploitable weaknesses in web application interfaces.

### 5. Exploitation Tools

- Used to perform targeted attacks once vulnerabilities have been identified.
- Examples:
  - Tools that simulate breaking into systems ("kicking in the door") or exploiting weak points.
  - Purpose: Confirm vulnerabilities and evaluate the potential impact of successful attacks.

### 6. General-Purpose Platforms

- Platforms that bundle various tools for a range of cybersecurity operations.
- Examples:
  - Kali Linux: A comprehensive suite containing tools for reconnaissance, exploitation, and more.
  - Purpose: Provide a one-stop solution for testing and security assessments.

Each category plays a critical role in cybersecurity workflows, from initial reconnaissance to vulnerability exploitation and mitigation planning.
